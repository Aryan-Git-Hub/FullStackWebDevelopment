display property in CSS
1) display: block;
    a) container will take whole space from left to right according to the parent
    b) custom height and width, margin and padding can be set
    c) example: div is a block element

2) display: inline;
    a) container will take space according to the content written inside it
    b) custom height and width can't be set, only horizontal margin can set, also padding can't be change or set
    c) example: span is an inline element

3) display: inline-block;
---> if we apply this property then the container work as a inline element i.e. take space according to the content inside it but we can change its width and height, margin and padding also like a block element.
